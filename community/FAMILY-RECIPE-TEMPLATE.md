# Example Submission

## The Chen Family's 番茄鸡蛋面

### Basic Information

| Field | Answer |
|-------|--------|
| **Family Name** | Chen (陈) |
| **Region of Origin** | Fujian Province, now in San Francisco |
| **How Many Generations?** | 3 that we know of |
| **Who Taught You?** | My 奶奶 (grandmother) |
| **Special Occasion or Everyday?** | Everyday, but especially sick days |

### The Story

My grandmother came to the United States in 1982, and this was one of the first dishes she taught my mother. She always said that no matter where we lived, as long as we could find tomatoes and eggs, we'd never be too far from home.

When I was growing up in San Francisco, this was the dish my mother made whenever I was sick. She'd bring the bowl to my bed and tell me it had "healing powers." I'm pretty sure she was right.

Now I make it for my own children, using the same technique 奶奶 taught - always crack the eggs directly into the soup, never scramble them first. She said it keeps them more tender.

### Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Tomatoes | 2 large | Very ripe, almost soft |
| Eggs | 2 | Room temperature |
| Thin wheat noodles | 1 bundle | We use 龙须面 |
| Scallions | 2 stalks | White and green separated |
| Ginger | 3 slices | Smashed |
| Chicken stock | 3 cups | Grandma used water, we prefer stock |
| Salt | To taste | |
| White pepper | Pinch | |
| Sesame oil | Drizzle | At the very end |

### Method

**Step 1: The Base**
Heat oil, fry scallion whites and ginger until fragrant. Grandma always said "you should smell it before you see it change color."

**Family tip:** The ginger should be smashed, not sliced thin. This releases more flavor and you can remove the pieces before serving.

**Step 2: The Tomatoes**
Add tomatoes cut into wedges. Don't cut too small - grandma liked seeing the pieces in the soup. Add a pinch of salt, cook until slightly softened but still holding shape (about 3 minutes).

**Family tip:** "Not too much cooking - the soup should taste fresh, not like ketchup."

**Step 3: The Soup**
Add stock, bring to simmer. Season with salt and white pepper. Simmer 5 minutes.

**Step 4: The Eggs (The Secret)**
Crack eggs directly into simmering soup, one at a time, letting them poach rather than scrambling. Let set 2 minutes. This creates silky, whole-yolk eggs.

**Family tip:** This is what makes our version different. The eggs are almost like poached eggs floating in the soup.

**Step 5: Assembly**
Cook noodles separately, drain, place in bowl. Ladle soup with one egg per bowl. Top with scallion greens and sesame oil.

### The Secret

Cracking whole eggs into the soup instead of scrambling. The yolk breaks when you eat it and enriches every bite.

### What This Dish Means to Me

This dish is my connection to three generations of Chen women who all lived far from their birthplace. When I make it for my daughters, I'm passing on not just a recipe but our family's story of adaptation and resilience. We've been making home in new places for generations, one bowl at a time.
