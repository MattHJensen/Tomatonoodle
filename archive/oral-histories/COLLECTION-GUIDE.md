## Why Oral Histories Matter

Written recipes tell us **what** people cooked. Oral histories tell us:
- **Who** taught them
- **When** they learned
- **Where** variations came from
- **Why** the dish matters to them
- **How** the recipe changed over generations

For a dish as personal as tomato noodle soup, oral histories are irreplaceable primary sources.

## Sample Interview Excerpts

### Example 1: Beijing, 1940s Memory

**Subject:** Mrs. Wang, 86, Beijing native
**Date:** [Example]

> "When I was a little girl, we didn't have tomatoes. They were only in the foreign restaurants in the Legation Quarter. My mother first bought one in maybe 1945 or 1946. She didn't know what to do with it. The neighbor told her to stir-fry it with eggs. That's how we learned."

### Example 2: Chengdu, 1980s Restaurant

**Subject:** Mr. Chen, 72, former noodle shop worker
**Date:** [Example]

> "I worked on Huaxing Street from 1983. We started with just 煎蛋面, fried egg noodles. The tomato version came because customers asked for something different. Someone said, 'Put some tomato in the soup.' We tried it. It was popular immediately, especially with the late-night crowd."

### Example 3: San Francisco, Diaspora

**Subject:** Mrs. Lin, 65, immigrated 1985
**Date:** [Example]

> "This was the first dish I made when I came to America. My mother showed me before I left. She said, 'Even if you can't find anything else, you can find tomatoes and eggs.' She was right. It tasted like home, even in a strange kitchen."
