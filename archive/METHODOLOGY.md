## I. Source Classification

### Primary Sources

**Definition:** Original documents from the historical period being studied.

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Texts** | Original essays, recipes, government records |
| **Images** | Contemporary photographs, illustrations |
| **Oral histories** | First-person accounts from witnesses |
| **Artifacts** | Menus, cookbooks, kitchen tools |
| **Audio/Video** | Recordings from the period |

### Secondary Sources

**Definition:** Scholarly analysis and interpretation of primary sources.

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Academic articles** | Peer-reviewed research |
| **Books** | Historical studies, food scholarship |
| **Documentaries** | Historical documentaries |
| **Encyclopedias** | Reference works |

### Tertiary Sources

**Definition:** Compilations and summaries of secondary sources.

| Type | Examples |

## II. Source Evaluation

### Assessing Reliability

| Question | Consideration |
|----------|---------------|
| **Who created it?** | Author's qualifications, perspective, biases |
| **When was it created?** | Contemporary to events or retrospective? |
| **Why was it created?** | Purpose affects content and framing |
| **Where was it created?** | Geographic and cultural context |
| **How was it preserved?** | Chain of custody, potential alterations |

### Confidence Levels

We use four levels of confidence:

| Level | Symbol | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Confirmed** | ✓✓ | Multiple independent sources agree |
| **Probable** | ✓ | Strong evidence with minor gaps |
| **Possible** | ? | Circumstantial evidence only |
| **Speculative** | ~ | Logical inference, no direct evidence |

### Handling Contradictions

When sources conflict:
1. Note all versions
2. Assess source reliability
3. Present majority view with alternatives
4. Avoid false certainty

5. **Confidence level** - Per scale above

## IV. Documentation Standards

### Text Transcription

When transcribing Chinese texts:

1. **Preserve original characters** - Traditional or simplified as in original
2. **Note variant readings** - If characters are unclear
3. **Provide pinyin** - For accessibility
4. **Include translation** - Into English
5. **Note translator** - Who translated

**Format:**
```
Original: [Chinese characters]
Pinyin: [Romanization]
Translation: [English]
Source: [Citation]
Translator: [Name or "archive staff"]
```

### Image Documentation

When documenting visual sources:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Description** | What does the image show? |
| **Date** | When was it created/taken? |
| **Creator** | Photographer, artist, publisher |
| **Location** | Where is the original held? |
| **Copyright** | Status and usage rights |
| **Condition** | Quality, completeness |

### Oral History Documentation

Per the [Oral History Collection Guide](oral-histories/COLLECTION-GUIDE.md):

1. **Metadata** - Subject, date, location, interviewer
2. **Recording** - Audio or video file
3. **Consent** - Documented permission
4. **Transcript** - Full or key excerpts
5. **Summary** - Brief overview

---

## V. Language Standards

### Chinese Text Handling

| Element | Standard |
|---------|----------|
| **Characters** | Simplified (简体) default; note if traditional |
| **Romanization** | Pinyin with tone marks preferred |
| **Names** | Chinese order (surname first) |
| **Dates** | Convert to Western calendar with Chinese calendar note |

### Translation Principles

1. **Accuracy** - Meaning over literal word-for-word
2. **Context** - Preserve cultural context
3. **Transparency** - Note difficult passages
4. **Multiple translations** - Note if varying translations exist

### Bilingual Formatting

All major documents should include:
- Chinese titles with pinyin and English
- Key terms in both languages
- Summaries accessible in English

---

## VI. Digital Preservation

### File Formats

| Content Type | Preferred Format | Acceptable |
|--------------|------------------|------------|
| Text documents | Markdown (.md) | Plain text (.txt) |
| Images | PNG, TIFF | JPEG (lossy) |
| Audio | FLAC, WAV | MP3 (note compression) |
| Video | MP4 (H.264) | Various |
| Scans | PDF/A | PDF |

### Metadata Standards

All digital files should include:

```
Filename: [Descriptive name with date]
Title: [Full title]
Creator: [Author/photographer/etc.]
Date: [Creation date]
Description: [Brief description]
Subject: [Keywords]
Rights: [Copyright status]
Archive ID: [Unique identifier]
```

### Backup and Redundancy

- Multiple copies in different locations
- Git version control for text
- Regular integrity checks
- Consider Internet Archive backup

---

## VII. Research Ethics

### Respect for Sources

- **Acknowledgment** - Credit all sources
- **Permission** - Obtain rights when required
- **Accuracy** - Don't misrepresent sources
- **Context** - Don't quote out of context

### Respect for Subjects

- **Consent** - Always obtain for oral histories
- **Privacy** - Honor anonymity requests
- **Sensitivity** - Be aware of cultural issues
- **Benefit** - Share results with communities

### Academic Integrity

- **No fabrication** - Don't invent sources
- **No plagiarism** - Cite all borrowed content
- **Transparency** - Note limitations and uncertainties
- **Corrections** - Update errors when found

---

## VIII. Handling Uncertainty

### What We Don't Know

It's important to acknowledge gaps:

```
✓ DO: "The earliest known recipe dates to approximately 1940, though
   earlier versions likely existed."

✗ DON'T: "The recipe was invented in 1940."
```

### Distinguishing Fact from Inference

| Statement Type | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| **Documented fact** | "Lao She wrote about tomatoes in 1935." |
| **Reasonable inference** | "Tomato-egg dishes were likely common in Shanghai by the 1940s." |
| **Speculation** | "Perhaps the first recipe came from a Shanghai housewife." |

Always label the type of claim you're making.
