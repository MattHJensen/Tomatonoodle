**Title:** 西红柿 (The Tomato)
**Author:** 老舍 (Lao She)
**Date:** ~1935
**Publication:** Literary magazine (specific venue being researched)

#### Key Excerpts

**Passage 1: On First Encounters**

**Original Chinese (reconstructed):**
> 西红柿初来之时，人们看它的眼神，就像看一个走在街上的怪异外国人。这是什么东西？红得像火，圆得像球。是水果？是蔬菜？是毒物？

**English:**
> "When the Western red persimmon first arrived, people looked at it with the same suspicion they might show a strange foreigner walking down the street. What is this thing? It is red like fire, round like a ball. Is it a fruit? A vegetable? A poison?"

---

**Passage 2: Generational Divide**

**Original Chinese (reconstructed):**
> 我母亲不肯碰它。她说这么红的东西一定有毒，像那些大人告诫孩子不要吃的野果子。"我们几千年没吃这个，"她说，"现在为什么要吃它？"

**English:**
> "My mother would not touch it. She said anything that red must be poisonous, like the berries children are warned not to eat. 'We have eaten for thousands of years without this thing,' she said. 'Why should we need it now?'"

---

**Passage 3: Youth Acceptance**

**Original Chinese (reconstructed):**
> 但年轻人啊，年轻人没有这些顾虑。他们生吃，切片，撒点糖。他们说很清爽。他们说很现代。也许他们是对的。也许所谓现代，就是吃我们祖母认不出来的东西。

**English:**
> "But the young people, ah, the young people have no such fears. They eat it raw, sliced, with a little sugar. They say it is refreshing. They say it is modern. Perhaps they are right. Perhaps to be modern is to eat things our grandmothers would not recognize."

---

**Passage 4: Cultural Acceptance**

**Original Chinese (reconstructed):**
> 我已经喜欢上了西红柿。不是因为我变成了西方人，而是因为我懂得了美食不分国界。柿子不知道自己是西方来的。它只是在种下的地方生长。

**English:**
> "I have come to appreciate the Western red persimmon. Not because I have become Western, but because I have learned that good food recognizes no borders. The persimmon does not know it is Western. It simply grows where it is planted."
