# Agricultural History of Tomatoes in China

> *From ornamental curiosity to China's most consumed vegetable*

## 番茄在中国的农业史 | The Agrarian Journey

---

## Overview

The agricultural history of tomatoes in China is inseparable from the history of tomato noodle soup. Without mass cultivation, the dish could never have become "the most frequently cooked meal in China."

This document traces the agricultural journey from first seeds to industrial production.

## Phase I: Introduction (1550s-1650s)

### Routes of Entry

Tomatoes likely entered China through multiple routes:

| Route | Approximate Date | Evidence |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Portuguese Macau** | 1550s-1570s | Trade records, Portuguese presence |
| **Spanish Philippines** | 1570s-1600s | Manila galleon trade |
| **Overland Silk Road** | 1600s | Central Asian botanical records |
| **Dutch Taiwan** | 1624-1662 | Dutch East India Company |

### First Seeds

**Earliest Documentary Evidence:**

The exact date of first tomato arrival is unknown, but circumstantial evidence suggests:

| Period | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| 1557 | Portuguese establish permanent Macau settlement |
| 1560s-1580s | Portuguese gardens in Macau likely included tomatoes |
| ~1600 | First Chinese botanical descriptions appear |

### Ming Dynasty Botanical Records

**《群芳谱》(Qunfangpu)** by Wang Xiangjin (1621):
- First major Chinese text describing tomatoes
- Classified as ornamental, not food
- Regional name variations recorded

**Classification:**
```
Kingdom: 植物界 (Plant Kingdom)
Family: 茄科 (Nightshade family)
Chinese name: 番茄 (Foreign eggplant)
Status: 观赏植物 (Ornamental plant)
Edibility: 不可食 (Not for eating)
```

---

## Phase II: Ornamental Period (1650-1880)

### Garden Cultivation

For over 200 years, tomatoes were grown primarily as curiosities:

| Location | Purpose | Scale |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Scholar gardens | Decoration | Individual plants |
| Medicinal gardens | Topical remedies | Small patches |
| Foreign concessions | European residents' food | Kitchen gardens |
| Missionary compounds | Familiar vegetables | Limited |

### Why No Food Cultivation?

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Nightshade fear** | Other nightshades were known poisons |
| **Culinary tradition** | No existing framework for tomato cooking |
| **Seed availability** | Limited access to viable seeds |
| **Climate misunderstanding** | Uncertain about growing conditions |
| **Market absence** | No consumer demand |

### Regional Distribution

By 1800, tomato plants existed in:
- Coastal treaty port areas
- Major cities (Beijing, Nanjing, Hangzhou)
- Some provincial capitals
- Missionary stations inland

But remained rare and purely ornamental.

## Phase III: Experimental Agriculture (1880-1920)

### The 1908 Import Record

**Landmark Document:**
The Qing government's agricultural bureau recorded the first official import of tomato seeds specifically for agricultural experimentation.

| Field | Information |
|-------|-------------|
| **Year** | 1908 |
| **Source** | Russia (likely Siberian varieties) |
| **Purpose** | Agricultural experimentation |
| **Location** | Government experimental farms |
| **Significance** | First official recognition of food potential |

### Why Russia?

The Russian tomato varieties imported in 1908 were likely:
- Cold-hardy strains developed for Siberian growing
- Already adapted to northern climates
- Available through Manchurian trade connections
- Tested in similar continental conditions

### Experimental Farms

| Location | Established | Focus |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Nanjing | ~1910 | Vegetable variety trials |
| Beijing | ~1912 | Northern climate adaptation |
| Shanghai | ~1915 | Commercial production tests |
| Guangzhou | ~1918 | Southern varieties |

### Early Varieties

The first cultivated varieties in China were likely:

| Variety Type | Characteristics | Use |
|--------------|-----------------|-----|
| **Russian pink** | Cold-hardy, mealy | Fresh eating |
| **Italian plum** | High acid, firm | Processing |
| **American beefsteak** | Large, sweet | Western restaurants |

---

## Phase IV: Commercial Introduction (1920-1949)

### Urban Market Gardens

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 1920s | Small market gardens around Shanghai |
| 1930s | Expanded cultivation near major cities |
| 1940s | Wartime gardens, survival cultivation |

### Shanghai's Role

Shanghai served as the agricultural laboratory:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Western demand** | European residents wanted tomatoes |
| **Restaurant market** | Western restaurants needed supply |
| **Agricultural science** | Foreign-trained agronomists |
| **Seed distribution** | Commercial seed companies emerged |

### Price and Availability

| Period | Price Level | Availability |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 1920s | Luxury item | Elite markets only |
| 1930s | Expensive | Urban markets |
| 1940s | Moderate | Seasonal availability |

### Wartime Agriculture (1937-1945)

During the Second Sino-Japanese War:
- Victory gardens included tomatoes
- Survival cooking incorporated available vegetables
- Refugee populations learned new foods
- Agricultural knowledge spread with population movement

---

## Phase V: Socialist Agriculture (1949-1978)

### State Agricultural Planning

The new People's Republic prioritized food security:

| Year | Policy |
|------|--------|
| 1949-1952 | Land reform, redistribution |
| 1953-1957 | First Five-Year Plan, collectivization |
| 1958-1962 | Great Leap Forward, commune farming |
| 1963-1965 | Recovery, pragmatic agriculture |
| 1966-1976 | Cultural Revolution disruptions |

### Tomato Cultivation Expansion

| Period | Scale | Location |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 1950s | Expanded urban gardens | Major cities |
| 1960s | Commune cultivation | Suburban areas |
| 1970s | Provincial distribution | Most provinces |

### Seed Development

Chinese agricultural scientists developed local varieties:

| Variety | Developed | Characteristics |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| 北京早红 | 1960s | Early ripening for north |
| 上海粉红 | 1965 | Pink, sweet, Shanghai area |
| 强力米寿 | 1970s | Disease resistant |

### Cafeteria Standard

Tomato-egg dishes became cafeteria standards because:

| Factor | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| **Cost** | Cheap protein + cheap vegetable |
| **Nutrition** | Government promoted balanced meals |
| **Simplicity** | Easy mass production |
| **Acceptance** | Mild flavor, broad appeal |
| **Availability** | Increasingly common supply |

### Xinjiang: China's Tomato Capital

Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has become China's processing tomato heartland:

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Production | ~15 million tonnes/year |
| Share of China | ~25% |
| Primary use | Tomato paste export |
| Major buyers | Italy, EU, Middle East |

**Why Xinjiang?**
- Arid climate reduces disease
- Extreme sunshine increases sugar content
- Large flat areas for mechanization
- Irrigation from snowmelt

## Connection to Recipe History

### How Agriculture Enabled the Dish

| Agricultural Development | Recipe Impact |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| 1908 seed imports | Experimentation begins |
| 1920s-30s urban cultivation | First recipes appear |
| 1950s-60s expansion | Cafeteria standardization |
| 1978+ reforms | Home cooking explosion |
| 2000s year-round supply | Daily availability |

### The Feedback Loop

```
More cultivation → Lower prices →
More consumption → More recipes →
More demand → More cultivation
```

This positive feedback loop transformed tomatoes from exotic import to China's most consumed vegetable after Chinese cabbage.
