## 番茄在中国的历史 | The Journey of Tomatoes in China

---

## Pre-History: The Tomato Before China

### Origins in the Americas

| Period | Event |
|--------|-------|
| 7000 BCE | Wild tomatoes (Solanum pimpinellifolium) in Andean region |
| 500 BCE | Domestication by Aztecs and other Mesoamerican peoples |
| 1519 | Cortés encounters tomatoes in Aztec markets |
| 1544 | First European description by Pietro Andrea Mattioli |
| 1550s | Tomatoes spread through Mediterranean via Spanish trade |

**Nahuatl Origin:** The word "tomato" derives from Nahuatl "tomatl" (meaning "fat water" or "swelling fruit")

---

## Phase I: Introduction to China (1550s-1650s)

### The Portuguese Connection

| Date | Event | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1557 | Portuguese establish Macau trading post | Historical record |
| 1560s-1580s | Likely first tomato seeds arrive via Portuguese traders | Inferred |
| ~1600 | Tomatoes appear in Chinese botanical records | Ming Dynasty texts |

### First Chinese Name: 番茄 (Foreign Eggplant)

The earliest Chinese name reveals the cultural perception:
- **番** (fān) = foreign, barbarian
- **茄** (qié) = eggplant

This naming convention classified tomatoes with other "foreign" nightshades, immediately marking them as exotic imports rather than native foods.

### Ming Dynasty Records

**《群芳谱》(Qunfangpu, "Compendium of Flowers and Plants")** by Wang Xiangjin (王象晋), 1621

> First major Chinese botanical work to describe tomatoes. Classified as ornamental plant, not food.

**《本草纲目》(Bencao Gangmu, "Comperta of Materia Medica")** by Li Shizhen (李时珍), 1596

> The great pharmacopeia mentions tomato-like plants but does not recommend consumption. Focus on medicinal rather than culinary use.

---

## Phase II: The Ornamental Period (1650-1880)

### 300 Years as "Inedible" Decorations

For approximately three centuries, tomatoes in China were grown primarily as:
- Garden ornamentals
- Curiosity plants
- Medicinal specimens (topical use)

### Why Were Tomatoes Rejected as Food?

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Nightshade family** | Related to known poisonous plants |
| **Foreign origin** | Cultural suspicion of "barbarian" foods |
| **No culinary tradition** | No existing recipes or preparation methods |
| **Taste profile** | Acidity unfamiliar to Chinese palate |
| **Appearance** | Bright red color associated with danger in nature |

### Regional Variations in Naming

Different regions developed different names, all emphasizing foreign origin:

| Region | Name | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| South China | 番茄 (fānqié) | Foreign eggplant |
| North China | 西红柿 (xīhóngshì) | Western red persimmon |
| Some areas | 洋柿子 (yángshìzi) | Ocean/foreign persimmon |
| Literary | 六月柿 (liùyuèshì) | Sixth-month persimmon |

---

## Phase III: Early Adoption (1880-1920)

### The Treaty Port Influence

| Date | Event | Location |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1842+ | Treaty ports open to Western trade | Shanghai, Canton, etc. |
| 1880s | Western hotels begin serving tomato dishes | Shanghai |
| 1890s | First Chinese cooks learn tomato preparation | Treaty ports |
| 1908 | First official record of tomato seeds imported from Russia | Government agricultural records |

### Agricultural Introduction

**1908 Agricultural Import Record:**
> The Qing government's agricultural bureau documented the first official import of tomato seeds from Russia for experimental cultivation. This marks the transition from ornamental to potential food crop.

### First Western-Style Restaurants

Western restaurants in Shanghai, known as 番菜馆 (fāncàiguǎn, "foreign food restaurants"), began serving:
- Tomato soup (罗宋汤, Russian borscht adaptation)
- Tomato-based sauces
- Western-style stewed dishes

These restaurants employed Chinese cooks who learned Western techniques, creating a bridge for tomato adoption.

---

## Phase IV: Cultural Negotiation (1920-1949)

### The Shanghai Experiment

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 1920s | Chinese-Western fusion restaurants emerge |
| 1925-1935 | Tomato dishes appear on Chinese restaurant menus |
| 1930s | Home cooks begin experimenting with tomatoes |
| 1935 | Lao She publishes "The Tomato" essay |

### Lao She's "The Tomato" (西红柿, 1935)

**Primary Source Document**

This essay by one of China's greatest modern writers captures the cultural moment of tomato adoption:

**Key Passages (translated):**

> "When the Western red persimmon first arrived, people looked at it with the same suspicion they might show a strange foreigner walking down the street."

> "My mother would not touch it. She said anything that red must be poisonous, like the berries children are warned not to eat."

> "But the young people, ah, the young people have no such fears. They eat it raw, sliced, with a little sugar. They say it is refreshing."

> "I have come to appreciate the Western red persimmon. Not because I have become Western, but because I have learned that good food recognizes no borders."

**Historical Significance:**
- Documents generational divide in food acceptance
- Captures exact moment of cultural transition
- Provides primary source evidence of attitudes toward "foreign" food
- Written by canonical literary figure, preserved in archives

### The Tomato-Egg Combination Emerges

**Earliest Known Documentation: Late 1930s-Early 1940s**

The combination of tomato and egg appears to have emerged from:
1. **Western influence** - Eggs commonly paired with tomatoes in Western cooking
2. **Chinese adaptation** - Stir-fry technique applied to Western ingredients
3. **Practical factors** - Both ingredients cheap, accessible, quick-cooking
4. **Nutritional complementation** - Perhaps intuited: eggs lack vitamin C, tomatoes provide it

### First Recipe Publications

| Year | Publication | Recipe |
|------|-------------|--------|
| ~1940 | Shanghai household magazines | 番茄炒蛋 (stir-fried tomato egg) |
| 1943 | Wartime recipe booklets | Simple tomato-egg dishes |
| 1945 | Post-war cooking guides | Various tomato preparations |

**Note:** The noodle soup version appears slightly later than the stir-fried version.

## Phase V: National Proliferation (1949-1978)

### The People's Republic and Tomato Cultivation

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1949 | People's Republic established |
| 1950s | Collectivized agriculture expands vegetable variety |
| 1956 | Tomato cultivation officially promoted in agricultural plans |
| 1960s | Tomatoes become common in urban markets |
| 1970s | Rural distribution increases |

### The "Iron Rice Bowl" Era

During this period, work unit (单位) cafeterias served tomato-egg dishes because:
- **Affordable** - Cheap ingredients for mass feeding
- **Nutritious** - Government promoted balanced nutrition
- **Practical** - Quick to prepare in large quantities
- **Ideologically neutral** - No longer seen as "bourgeois Western"

### The Noodle Soup Version Crystallizes

**Approximate Timeline:**

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 1950s | Tomato-egg served over rice in cafeterias |
| 1960s | Home cooks add noodles for more substantial meal |
| 1970s | Recipe stabilizes into recognizable form |
| Late 1970s | Regional variations begin to develop |

## Phase VI: Regional Differentiation (1978-2000)

### Reform Era and Culinary Renaissance

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1978 | Reform and Opening begins |
| 1980s | Private restaurants return |
| 1985 | Chengdu's Huaxing Street noodle culture emerges |
| 1990s | Regional styles solidify |
| 2000 | Internet begins spreading recipes |

### The Huaxing Street Origin Story

**Chengdu, Sichuan - 1980s**

According to oral histories collected from long-time Chengdu residents:

> "The late-night noodle stalls on Huaxing Street started serving 煎蛋面 (jiandanmian) in the early 1980s. It was food for taxi drivers, students, and lovers ending their dates. The tomato version came because someone wanted something different from plain noodles."

**Key Innovation:** The Chengdu version uses a whole fried egg rather than scrambled, distinguishing it from other regional styles.

### Regional Recipe Branches

| Region | Emerged | Distinctive Features |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Chengdu | ~1985 | Fried whole egg, thick tomato paste |
| Beijing | ~1980 | Egg drop, gravy style (打卤) |
| Shanghai | ~1982 | Light broth, sweeter flavor |
| Xi'an | ~1988 | Wide noodles, oil-splashed option |
| Taiwan | ~1960 | Beef noodle soup with tomato base |
| Hong Kong | ~1975 | Cha chaan teng macaroni version |
