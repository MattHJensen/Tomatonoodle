- Label with date

Method 3: Zip bags flat
- Pour into gallon bags
- Lay flat to freeze
- Stack like books

```

### Stock Inventory

## Troubleshooting Stocks

### Stock is Cloudy

| Cause | Prevention |
|-------|------------|
| Boiled too hard | Keep at low simmer |
| Didn't blanch first | Always blanch bones |
| Didn't skim | Skim regularly |

**Can you fix it?**
Yes - clarify with egg whites (advanced technique)

### Stock is Weak

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Too much water | Reduce by simmering uncovered |
| Not enough bones | Add bouillon cube to boost |
| Didn't cook long enough | Simmer longer next time |

### Stock is Too Salty

| Fix | How |
|-----|-----|
| Dilute | Add water |
| Use less | Cut with plain water in recipe |
| Add potato | Absorbs some salt |
