## Tips for Success

### General Principles

1. **Taste as you go** - Dietary versions need more adjustment
2. **Boost umami** - Compensate for any removed ingredients
3. **Don't apologize** - These are valid dishes, not "lesser" versions
4. **Quality matters more** - With fewer ingredients, each must shine

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Under-seasoning | Tastes bland | Use herbs, acid, umami |
| Wrong noodle texture | Disappointing | Match noodle to soup |
| Skipping technique | Loses depth | Still do 炒出沙 |
| Too many swaps | Unrecognizable dish | Change one thing at a time |
