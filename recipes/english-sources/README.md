## China Sichuan Food

### Tomato Noodles with Fried Egg (西红柿打卤面)

**Source:** [chinasichuanfood.com/tomato-noodles-with-fried-egg](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/tomato-noodles-with-fried-egg/)

**Author:** Elaine

**Regional Attribution:** The Chinese name "西红柿打卤面" literally translates to "noodles in tomato gravy" - a style common in Northern China where savory sauce is poured over plain noodles.

#### Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Fresh tomatoes | 2-3 | High juice content |
| Eggs | 2 | |
| Dried noodles | 1 portion | |
| Green onion | For garnish | |
| Oil | For frying | |

#### Two Methods for Egg Preparation

**Method 1 - Stir-fried eggs:**
- Stir-fry eggs first, then cut into pieces
- Results in larger egg pieces

**Method 2 - Egg drops:**
- Make egg drops directly in boiling tomato sauce
- Results in better mixing with sauce

#### Key Technique
When adding egg liquid: use high heat, pour in batches, waiting 10-20 seconds between each pour until liquid solidifies.

#### Tips from the Recipe
- Choose fresh tomatoes with abundant natural juices - this is the key to success
- Boil dried noodles for approximately 5 minutes
- Mix sauce with noodles before eating

**Author:** Wei Guo (UK-based Chinese food blogger)

**Regional Attribution:** A home-cooking staple across China; the author's parents from mainland China traditionally served this dish.

#### Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Tomatoes | 2 medium | Good quality, ripe |
| Eggs | 2 | |
| Garlic | 2 cloves | |
| Oil | 2 1/2 tablespoons total | |
| Water | 350 ml (1 1/2 cups) | |
| Water | 1 tablespoon | For beating eggs |
| Salt | To taste | |
| Sugar | Pinch | |
| Scallions or coriander | For garnish | |

#### Tomato Peeling Technique

1. Cut a cross on the opposite end from the stem
2. Soak in just-boiled water for a few minutes
3. Wait until the cut splits
4. Peel for smoother texture

#### Method

1. Beat eggs with 1 tbsp water until slightly foamy

2. Fry garlic until fragrant, then add tomatoes

3. Cook until mushy on edges

#### Cookware Warning
**Do not use traditional carbon steel woks** - the acid from tomatoes strips off seasoning. Use non-stick wok or deep skillet instead.
