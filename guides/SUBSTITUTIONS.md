## The Philosophy

Chinese tomato egg noodles is a fundamentally simple dish. Its beauty lies in:
- Basic ingredients available worldwide
- Techniques that transcend specific products
- Flexibility that rewards creativity

The goal of substitution is not to replicate exactly, but to **capture the essence** while working with what you have.

## Common Substitution Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Substituting Extra-Virgin Olive Oil

**Why it fails:** Strong flavor overwhelms the dish
**Better choice:** Any neutral oil, or light olive oil

### Mistake 2: Using Teriyaki Instead of Soy Sauce

**Why it fails:** Too sweet, wrong flavor profile
**Better choice:** Worcestershire + salt, or just salt

### Mistake 3: Dried Herbs Instead of Fresh Aromatics

**Why it fails:** Dried ginger/garlic lack freshness
**Better choice:** Extra of what you have, or onion

### Mistake 4: Thin Pasta Without Adjustment

**Why it fails:** Overcooks in hot soup
**Better choice:** Cook al dente, add at last moment

### Mistake 5: Ketchup as Sole Tomato Source

**Why it fails:** Too sweet, wrong texture
**Better choice:** Ketchup + fresh tomato or paste

### How to Evaluate a New Substitution

Ask yourself:

1. **Does it provide the same function?**
   - Noodles → starch and chew
   - Eggs → protein and richness
   - Tomatoes → acid and body

2. **Is the flavor profile compatible?**
   - Savory? Sweet? Sour?
   - Will it clash?

3. **Does the texture work?**
   - Too soft? Too hard?
   - How does it change with cooking?

4. **What's the cooking adjustment?**
   - More/less time?
   - Different technique?
