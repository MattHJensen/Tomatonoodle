## Technique 1: 炒出沙 (Stir-Fry Until Sandy)

This is the single most important technique. It transforms raw tomatoes into a rich, deeply flavored base.

### The Science

When tomatoes are cooked with salt and gentle heat:
1. **Cell walls break down** → releases pectin
2. **Water evaporates** → concentrates flavor
3. **Maillard reaction begins** → develops complexity
4. **Pectin thickens** → creates body ("沙" texture)

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Stage 1: Preparation
```
Tomatoes: 2 medium, peeled
Cut: 2-3 cm chunks (not too small)
Oil: 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Salt: 1/4 teaspoon
```

#### Stage 2: Initial Cook
```
1. Heat wok over MEDIUM heat (not high!)
2. Add oil, swirl to coat
3. Add tomato chunks in single layer
4. Sprinkle salt over tomatoes
5. Let sit 30 seconds without stirring
```

#### Stage 3: Breaking Down
```
6. Use spatula to press tomatoes against wok
7. Stir, then press again
8. Repeat for 2-3 minutes
9. Liquid will release, then start to evaporate
```

#### Stage 4: Achieving "沙"
```
10. Continue cooking 2-3 more minutes
11. Look for these signs:
    ✓ Oil separates and turns red/orange
    ✓ Tomato pieces lose definition
    ✓ Paste-like consistency
    ✓ Slight glossiness
12. Total time: 4-6 minutes
```

### Visual Progress Guide

```

```

### Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Tomatoes burning | Heat too high | Lower to medium |
| Still chunky after 5 min | Not pressing enough | Use spatula more actively |
| Watery, not paste-like | Undercooked | Continue 2-3 more minutes |
| Sticking to wok | Not enough oil | Add 1 more tbsp |
| Bitter taste | Burned | Start over, lower heat |

### Pro Tips

1. **Add a pinch of sugar** after achieving 沙 - enhances tomato's natural sweetness
2. **Use ripe tomatoes** - unripe won't break down properly
3. **Don't add water yet** - let the technique work first
4. **Listen for the sizzle** - should be gentle, not aggressive

## Technique 2: 滑蛋 (Silky Eggs)

The eggs in tomato egg noodles should be tender, slightly runny ribbons - never rubbery.

### The Goal

```
Perfect eggs:           Overcooked eggs:
- Soft curds            - Tough, bouncy
- Slightly glossy       - Matte, dry
- Tender ribbons        - Dense chunks
- Moist throughout      - Squeaky texture
```

### Method A: Egg Drop Style (蛋花)

For soup-based noodles where eggs float in ribbons.

#### Step-by-Step
```
1. Beat 1-2 eggs with:
   - Pinch of salt
   - 1 tsp water (optional, for fluffiness)

2. Bring soup to gentle simmer (NOT boiling)

3. Turn off heat

4. Slowly drizzle egg in thin stream:
   - Pour from height of 6-8 inches
   - Move in circular motion
   - Don't stir while pouring

5. Wait 30 seconds

6. Gently stir once to separate ribbons
```

#### Key Points
- **Simmer, not boil:** Boiling water breaks eggs into tiny bits
- **Pour slowly:** Creates long, elegant ribbons
- **Don't over-stir:** Let eggs set before disturbing

---

### Method B: Stir-Fried Eggs (炒蛋)

For dry-style or when eggs are cooked separately.

#### Step-by-Step
```
1. Beat 2 eggs with:
   - Pinch of salt
   - 1 tsp Shaoxing wine (optional)
   - 10ml water (for fluffiness)

2. Heat wok over HIGH heat

3. Add 2 tbsp oil, swirl

4. When oil shimmers (not smoking), add eggs

5. Let set on bottom for 3-5 seconds

6. Push from edges to center with spatula

7. When 80% set, remove immediately

8. Eggs will continue cooking off heat
```

#### The 80% Rule
```
Remove eggs when:    NOT when:
- Still slightly wet  - Completely set
- Soft curds          - Firm all over
- Glossy surface      - Matte surface
- Jiggly in center    - Solid throughout
```

### Method C: Fried Eggs Chengdu Style (煎蛋)

The Huaxing Street specialty - whole fried eggs on top.

#### Step-by-Step
```
1. Heat 2 tbsp oil in wok over medium-high

2. Crack eggs directly into wok

3. Spread yolks gently with chopstick (optional)
   - This increases egg coverage

4. Fry until edges are crispy, center still runny

5. Slide onto finished soup/noodles

6. Yolk breaks when eating, enriches broth
```

## Technique 3: 爆香 (Aromatics Base)

Building the flavor foundation with aromatics.

### The Classic Trio

```
葱 (Scallion)  +  姜 (Ginger)  +  蒜 (Garlic)
    香味            辛香           蒜香
   Allium         Spicy-warm      Pungent
```

### Standard Proportions (per serving)

| Aromatic | Amount | Prep |
|----------|--------|------|
| Scallion white | 1 stalk | Minced fine |
| Ginger | 2-3 slices | Minced or sliced |
| Garlic | 1-2 cloves | Minced |

### Step-by-Step

```
1. Heat oil over medium heat

2. Add aromatics in order:
   - Ginger first (needs longest cooking)
   - Wait 15 seconds
   - Add garlic and scallion whites
   - Wait 15 seconds

3. Stir until fragrant (30-45 seconds total)

4. Signs it's ready:
   ✓ Fragrant aroma rises
   ✓ Garlic turns light gold (NOT brown)
   ✓ Scallion softens

5. Immediately add tomatoes to prevent burning
```

### Regional Variations

| Region | Aromatics | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Standard | Scallion, ginger, garlic | Most common |
| Sichuan | + Dried chili, Sichuan peppercorn | Numbing-spicy base |
| Northern | Heavy on scallion | Uses more green onion |
| Shanghai | Light touch | Less aromatic, more subtle |
| Xinjiang | + Cumin, onion | Central Asian influence |

## Technique 4: 调汤 (Soup Building)

Creating the right broth for noodle soup.

### Liquid Options

| Liquid | Chinese | Flavor | Best For |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Water | 清水 | Neutral | Light, tomato-forward |
| Chicken stock | 鸡汤 | Savory, rich | Most recipes |
| Pork bone stock | 骨头汤 | Deep, meaty | Hearty versions |
| Vegetable stock | 蔬菜汤 | Light, clean | Vegetarian |
| Noodle water | 原汤 | Starchy | Northern style |

### The Golden Rule

> **加热水，不加冷水**
> Add HOT water, not cold water

Cold water:
- Shocks the aromatics
- Stops the cooking process
- Creates greasy film on surface
- Tough eggs if already added

Hot water:
- Maintains cooking temperature
- Emulsifies fats properly
- Smooth, integrated soup

### Standard Proportions (per serving)

```
Base (after 炒出沙):    Completed tomato paste
Liquid:                  2-2.5 cups (500-600ml)
Simmering time:          3-5 minutes
```

### Seasoning Guide

| Ingredient | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Salt | 1/2 tsp | Base seasoning |
| Light soy sauce | 1 tsp | Umami, color |
| White pepper | Pinch | Warmth, depth |
| Sesame oil | 1/2 tsp | Aroma (add at end) |
| Sugar | 1/2 tsp | Balance acidity |
| MSG (optional) | Pinch | Umami boost |

### Soup Styles

#### Clear Broth Style (清汤)
```
Light, tomato-forward:
- Use water or light stock
- Less cooking time for tomatoes
- Minimal seasoning
- Egg drop ribbons
```

#### Rich Broth Style (浓汤)
```
Hearty, substantial:
- Use chicken or pork stock
- Full 炒出沙 technique
- More tomato paste
- Longer simmer
```

#### Gravy Style (打卤)
```
Thick, poured over noodles:
- Minimal liquid
- Cornstarch slurry to thicken
- Coats noodles heavily
- Northern specialty
```

## Technique 5: 煮面 (Noodle Cooking)

Perfect noodles complete the dish.

### Water Preparation

```
Ratio:    1 liter water per 100g noodles
Salt:     1 tsp per liter (optional)
Pot:      Large enough for noodles to move freely
Heat:     Rolling boil before adding noodles
```

### Cooking Process

```
1. Bring water to rolling boil

2. Add noodles, stir immediately
   - Prevents sticking
   - Separates strands

3. Stir every 30 seconds

4. Test 1 minute before package time:
   - Bite a strand
   - Should be tender with slight firmness
   - No raw flour taste

5. Timing depends on style:
   - For soup: cook to done (will stay in hot soup)
   - For dry style: slightly undercook (residual heat)
```

### The Cold Rinse Debate

| Style | Rinse? | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Soup noodles | NO | Starch adds body to soup |
| Dry/mixed | YES | Prevents sticking |
| Cold noodles | YES | Stops cooking, firms texture |
| Northern tradition | YES | Prefers firmer texture |

### Timing Reference

| Noodle Type | Fresh | Dried |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Dragon beard | 30-60 sec | 1-2 min |
| Thin wheat | N/A | 3-4 min |
| Alkaline | 2-3 min | 3-4 min |
| Knife-cut | 3-4 min | 4-5 min |
| Hand-pulled | 2-3 min | N/A |

## Temperature Management

The secret to restaurant-quality results at home.

### The Problem

Home stoves are weaker than restaurant woks. This leads to:
- Ingredients steaming instead of searing
- Longer cook times
- Less "wok hei" (wok breath)

### The Solutions

#### 1. Mise en Place
```
Have everything ready before heating wok:
- Tomatoes cut
- Eggs beaten
- Aromatics minced
- Seasonings measured
- Water/stock hot
```

#### 2. Work in Batches
```
For 2+ servings:
- Cook eggs separately, set aside
- Cook aromatics + tomatoes
- Combine at the end
```

#### 3. Preheat Properly
```
Before adding oil:
- Heat empty wok until smoking slightly
- Add oil, swirl to coat
- Let oil heat 10 seconds
- Then add ingredients
```

#### 4. Don't Crowd
```
Crowding = steaming:
- Leave space between ingredients
- Cook in batches if needed
- Use largest wok/pan available
```
