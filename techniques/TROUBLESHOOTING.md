## Detailed Problem Solutions

## Problem 1: Watery Soup

### Symptoms
- Thin, brothy liquid
- Tomato flavor weak
- Lacks body and richness

### Causes & Fixes

| Cause | How to Identify | Fix |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| **Insufficient 炒出沙** | Tomatoes added to liquid too soon | Cook tomatoes 5-7 min before adding liquid |
| **Too much liquid** | Ratio was off | Simmer uncovered 5 min to reduce |
| **Watery tomatoes** | Out of season or hothouse | Add 1 tbsp tomato paste |
| **No stock** | Using plain water | Add bouillon cube or MSG |

### Prevention
```
Checklist before adding liquid:
✓ Oil has turned red/orange
✓ Tomatoes are paste-like, not chunky
✓ No pools of watery liquid
✓ Slight caramelization on edges
```

### Emergency Fix
```
If already watery:
1. Remove noodles and set aside
2. Simmer soup uncovered 5-10 min
3. Add 1 tbsp tomato paste
4. Add pinch of cornstarch slurry if needed
5. Return noodles to thickened soup
```

## Problem 2: Rubbery Eggs

### Symptoms
- Eggs bounce when bitten
- Tough, squeaky texture
- Dense rather than tender

### Causes & Fixes

| Cause | How to Identify | Fix |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| **Overcooked** | Cooked too long | Cannot fix; prevent next time |
| **Heat too high** | Edges browned excessively | Lower heat for eggs |
| **Added too early** | Sat in hot soup too long | Add eggs at very end |
| **Too much stirring** | Eggs broke into small tough bits | Stir less, let set |

### Prevention
```
The 80% rule for scrambled eggs:
- Remove when still slightly wet
- Eggs continue cooking off heat
- Better slightly underdone than overdone

For egg drop:
- Turn OFF heat before adding egg
- Pour slowly in thin stream
- Wait 30 seconds before stirring
```

### Technique Adjustment

**For stir-fried eggs:**
```
1. High heat, but not smoking
2. Oil should shimmer
3. Add eggs
4. Count to 3
5. Push from edges
6. Remove at 80% set
```

**For egg drop soup:**
```
1. Bring soup to simmer
2. Turn OFF heat
3. Slowly drizzle beaten egg
4. Wait 30 seconds
5. ONE gentle stir
6. Serve immediately
```

## Problem 3: Mushy Noodles

### Symptoms
- Noodles fall apart
- Paste-like texture
- No chew or bite

### Causes & Fixes

| Cause | How to Identify | Fix |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| **Overcooked** | Cooked past package time | Cannot fix; start over |
| **Sat in hot soup** | Made ahead, noodles in soup | Cook noodles last, serve immediately |
| **Wrong noodle type** | Used quick-cook in soup | Use sturdier noodles |
| **Too much water** | Noodles swimming in pot | Use more water next time |

### Prevention
```
Timing guide:
- Set timer for 1 minute LESS than package
- Test by biting
- Should have slight resistance in center
- Drain immediately when done
```

### Noodle Rescue (Partial)
```
If slightly overcooked:
1. Drain immediately
2. Rinse with cold water (stops cooking)
3. Add to soup at last moment
4. Serve immediately

If very overcooked:
- Cannot save
- Start fresh batch
- Use overcooked as starch thickener (blend into soup)
```

## Problem 4: Noodles Stuck Together

### Symptoms
- Clumped mass of noodles
- Can't separate strands
- Uneven cooking

### Causes & Fixes

| Cause | How to Identify | Fix |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| **Not stirred immediately** | Clumps formed at bottom | Cannot fully fix; try to separate |
| **Too little water** | Noodles crowded in pot | Use larger pot, more water |
| **Added before boiling** | Water was warm, not rolling boil | Wait for rolling boil |
| **Drained and sat** | Left sitting after draining | Toss with oil immediately |

### Prevention
```
Anti-clumping checklist:
✓ Large pot with lots of water
✓ Rolling boil before adding
✓ Stir within first 10 seconds
✓ Stir every 30 seconds
✓ Don't leave after draining
```

### Rescue Attempt
```
For clumped drained noodles:
1. Return to pot with fresh boiling water
2. Swish around gently
3. Try to separate with chopsticks
4. Drain again
5. Toss with small amount of oil
```

## Problem 5: Unbalanced Flavor

### Too Sour

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Acidic tomatoes | Add 1/2-1 tsp sugar |
| Added vinegar | Balance with sugar |
| Underripe tomatoes | Use riper next time; add sugar |

### Too Sweet

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Cherry tomatoes | Add splash of rice vinegar |
| Added too much sugar | Add pinch of salt + vinegar |
| Sweet stock | Use less stock, more water |

### Too Salty

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Over-seasoned | Add more water/stock + sugar |
| Salty stock | Dilute, add unsalted liquid |
| Too much soy sauce | Add water, lime juice |

### Too Bland

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Under-seasoned | Add salt, soy sauce, MSG |
| Watery tomatoes | Add tomato paste |
| No aromatics | Can't fully fix; add garlic now |
| Bad stock | Add bouillon cube |

## Problem 6: Oily Surface

### Symptoms
- Oil pools on surface
- Greasy mouthfeel
- Separation of oil and soup

### Causes & Fixes

| Cause | How to Identify | Fix |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| **Too much oil** | Obvious excess | Skim with spoon |
| **Cold liquid added** | Oil separated when temp dropped | Always add HOT liquid |
| **Not emulsified** | Didn't simmer long enough | Simmer vigorously 2 min |

### Prevention
```
Oil management:
- Use only 2 tbsp oil total
- Add HOT liquid (never cold)
- Simmer vigorously to emulsify
- Starch from noodles helps bind
```

### Fix
```
1. Use paper towel to absorb surface oil
2. Or use spoon to skim
3. Or add 1 tsp cornstarch slurry
4. Simmer to re-emulsify
```

## Problem 7: Tomatoes Won't Break Down

### Symptoms
- Still chunky after cooking
- Raw tomato texture
- Won't form paste

### Causes & Fixes

| Cause | How to Identify | Fix |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| **Underripe tomatoes** | Hard, pale, no aroma | Cook longer; add sugar |
| **Not enough salt** | Didn't help break down | Add pinch of salt, press more |
| **Heat too high** | Browning before softening | Lower heat, add splash water |
| **Didn't press** | Just stirred | Use spatula to actively mash |

### Prevention
```
Tomato selection:
- Choose ripe, red tomatoes
- Should give slightly when pressed
- Should smell like tomato at stem
- Heavy for size = juicy
```

### Fix
```
For stubborn tomatoes:
1. Add pinch of salt
2. Add 2 tbsp water
3. Cover and steam 2 minutes
4. Uncover and press with spatula
5. Repeat until broken down
```

## Problem 8: No "Wok Hei" / Flat Flavor

### Symptoms
- Tastes "boiled" not "fried"
- No depth or complexity
- Missing that restaurant quality

### Causes & Fixes

| Cause | How to Identify | Fix |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| **Heat too low** | Nothing sizzles | Increase heat |
| **Wok not preheated** | Oil didn't smoke | Heat wok first, then add oil |
| **Too much in pan** | Steaming not frying | Cook in batches |
| **No Maillard reaction** | No browning | Let ingredients sit longer before stirring |

### Prevention
```
Wok hei checklist:
✓ Wok smoking before oil
✓ Oil shimmers before ingredients
✓ Hear active sizzling throughout
✓ Some caramelization on tomatoes
✓ Edges of eggs slightly browned
```

### Building Depth at Home
```
Since home stoves are weaker:
1. Use small batches
2. Don't stir constantly - let sit and sear
3. Get some char on tomatoes before adding liquid
4. Add tiny bit of butter at end (restaurant secret)
```

## Problem 9: Soup Cooled Down

### Symptoms
- Serving temperature too low
- Fat congealing
- Noodles absorbing liquid

### Causes & Fixes

| Cause | How to Identify | Fix |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| **Prep took too long** | Temperature dropped during assembly | Warm bowls, work faster |
| **Cold noodles** | Drained and sat | Toss with hot soup, or rewarm |
| **Too much delay** | Made ahead | Reheat before serving |

### Prevention
```
Temperature management:
1. Warm serving bowls with hot water
2. Have all components ready before assembly
3. Work quickly: noodles → soup → eggs → serve
4. Time so everything finishes together
```

### Reheating
```
If soup cooled:
1. Return to pot
2. Bring to simmer
3. Adjust seasoning (may have dulled)
4. Add fresh egg ribbons
5. Serve immediately
```

## Problem 10: Inconsistent Results

### Symptoms
- Sometimes great, sometimes not
- Can't replicate success
- Random variations

### Root Causes & Solutions

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Varying tomato quality** | Standardize source, add tomato paste for consistency |
| **Different noodle brands** | Adjust cooking time per brand |
| **Heat differences** | Note what works on your stove |
| **No measurements** | Measure key ingredients until muscle memory |
| **Rushing** | Follow process each time |

### Building Consistency
```
Keep a cooking log:
- Tomato brand/type
- Noodle brand
- Cooking times
- Any adjustments
- Result rating

Review to identify patterns.
```

## Emergency Situations

### "I Burned It"

```
Assessment:
- Light burn: Scrape off, transfer to new pot
- Medium burn: Start over (flavor permeates)
- Heavy burn: Definitely start over
```

### "I Added Way Too Much Salt"

```
Fixes in order of effectiveness:
1. Add more liquid (dilute)
2. Add raw potato, cook 5 min, remove (absorbs salt)
3. Add acid (lime juice) to balance perception
4. Add sugar to balance
5. Make double batch, combine (serious over-salt only)
```

### "The Power Went Out"

```
If you have gas:
- Continue cooking carefully

If no heat:
- Eggs: Eat raw egg in hot soup (温泉蛋 style)
- Noodles: If par-cooked, will soften in hot soup
- Tomatoes: Raw tomato soup is a thing
```

### "I Have 5 Minutes"

```
Extreme speed version:
1. Microwave: 1 cup water + 2 tbsp tomato paste (2 min)
2. Meanwhile: Beat 1 egg
3. Stir egg into hot tomato water
4. Pour over instant noodles
5. Add soy sauce, sesame oil
6. Eat immediately
```
