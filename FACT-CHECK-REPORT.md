## Corrections Needed ⚠️

### 1. "87% of Chinese Households Cook Tomato-Egg Weekly"
- **Location:** Hero section statistics (line 77-78), Timeline section (line 335)
- **Status:** ⚠️ UNVERIFIABLE
- **Finding:** No primary source found for this statistic. Search results cite "China Culinary Association 2023 survey" but this appears to be AI-generated summary without verifiable source.
- **Recommendation:** Remove specific percentage or change to softer language like "a majority of" or "commonly cooked in"

### 2. "1908: Qing Government Imports Tomato Seeds from Russia"
- **Location:** Timeline section (lines 290-298)
- **Status:** ⚠️ NOT VERIFIED
- **Finding:** No historical evidence found for this specific claim. Tomatoes were already cultivated in China before 1908.
- **Recommendation:** Remove or replace with verified information about late Qing agricultural developments

### 3. "35% of World's Tomatoes"
- **Location:** Timeline section (line 335)
- **Status:** ⚠️ SLIGHTLY INACCURATE
- **Finding:** Actual figure is approximately 37% (69M of ~186M tonnes globally)
- **Recommendation:** Update to "37%" or "over one-third"

### 4. "~68 Million Tonnes"
- **Location:** Timeline section (line 335), Archive section (line 566)
- **Status:** ⚠️ SLIGHTLY LOW
- **Finding:** More accurate figure is 69 million tonnes (2022-2024 data)
- **Recommendation:** Update to "69 million tonnes" or round to "~70 million tonnes"

### 5. Huaxing Street "Origin: 1980s"
- **Location:** Chengdu region data (index.html line 428, main.js line 79)
- **Status:** ⚠️ INCORRECT
- **Finding:** Huaxing Street fried egg noodles trace back to the **Qing Dynasty**, not the 1980s
- **Source:** [ChineseFoodFan](https://chinesefoodfan.com/recipes/memories-of-old-chengdu-fried-egg-noodles-on-huaxing-street-share/) states: "The history of the noodles with fried eggs on Huaxing Street can be traced back to the Qing dynasty"
- **Recommendation:** Change to "Qing Dynasty origin, revived 1980s" or similar

### 6. Lao She Quote Authenticity
- **Location:** Timeline section (lines 304-306)
- **Status:** ⚠️ UNCERTAIN
- **Finding:** While Lao She did write tomato essays in 1935, the specific quote "My mother would not touch it..." may be reconstructed/paraphrased rather than a direct translation
- **Recommendation:** Add caveat like "(paraphrased)" or source the translation

### 7. "Xinjiang Produces 25% of China's Tomatoes"
- **Location:** main.js, Xinjiang regionData (line 148)
- **Status:** ⚠️ INCORRECT
- **Finding:** Xinjiang produces **over 70%** of China's tomatoes. The 25% figure refers to China's share of GLOBAL production.
