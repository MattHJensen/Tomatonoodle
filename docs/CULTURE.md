## Literary References

### Lao She's "The Tomato" (西红柿, 1935)

The most significant literary treatment of tomatoes in Chinese cuisine comes from Lao She (老舍, 1899-1966), one of China's greatest modern writers.

**Key Excerpts (translated):**

> "The tomato is not Chinese. It comes from the West, carrying with it an air of foreignness that some find appealing and others suspicious."

> "When I first saw a tomato, I thought it was a kind of persimmon that had lost its way. Red, round, sitting there looking confused about which country it belonged to."

**Significance:**
- Documents 1930s cultural tension around Western foods
- Captures the moment of tomato's transition from curiosity to acceptance
- Written when tomatoes were still novel in Chinese households

### Lu Xun's Food References

While Lu Xun (鲁迅, 1881-1936) didn't write specifically about tomato noodles, his essays on Chinese food culture provide context:

> "What the Chinese eat is not merely food, but memory. Every dish carries the weight of generations."

This sentiment perfectly captures why tomato egg noodles, despite using a "foreign" ingredient, has become so deeply embedded in Chinese cultural identity.

### Contemporary Food Writing

**From "Shark's Fin and Sichuan Pepper" by Fuchsia Dunlop:**

> "Tomato and egg stir-fry... is one of the most common home-cooked dishes in China today, a simple combination that perfectly illustrates how Chinese cuisine has absorbed foreign ingredients and made them its own."

**From "The Woks of Life" blog:**

> "Just a whiff of this cooking and folks will tell tales of sitting in or near the kitchen as a kid as a parent made this dish."
