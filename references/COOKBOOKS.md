## Part 4: Public Domain Historical Cookbooks

### The Chinese Cook Book by Shiu Wong Chan (1917)

| Field | Information |
|-------|-------------|
| **Author** | Shiu Wong Chan |
| **Year** | 1917 |
| **Status** | **NO TOMATO RECIPES** |
| **Access** | [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/chinesecookbook00chan) |

**Notes:** This public domain cookbook contains various noodle soup recipes:
- Yat Koi Min (Noodle Soup)
- Noodle Soup with Chicken and Mushrooms
- Noodle Soup in Yung Chow Style

However, **no tomato recipes** were found. This is historically accurate - tomatoes were not widely used in Chinese home cooking until later in the 20th century.

### Other Archive.org Resources

The Internet Archive contains several other historical Chinese cookbooks from the early-to-mid 20th century. Most predate the widespread adoption of tomatoes in Chinese cuisine (post-1949), so tomato noodle soup recipes are unlikely to appear.

**Recommended Search Terms:**
- "Chinese cookbook" (filtered by date: before 1950)
- "Chinese cooking" (filtered by date: after 1970)

### Historical Note

> **Tomato noodle soup (番茄鸡蛋面 / fan qie ji dan mian)** became popular in China post-reform era (after 1978) and spread rapidly as a comfort food. Earlier cookbooks (pre-1970s) are unlikely to contain this recipe as tomatoes were not traditionally used in Chinese cuisine until relatively recently.
