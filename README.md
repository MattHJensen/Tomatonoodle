2. Use medium heat, cook 4-6 minutes
3. Press with spatula to break down
4. Oil should turn red/orange when done
5. Texture becomes paste-like, not chunky
```

## Why This Dish Matters

> "Just a whiff of this cooking and folks will tell tales of sitting in or near the kitchen as a kid as a parent made this dish."

Chinese tomato noodle soup represents:

1. **Culinary Adaptation** - How Chinese cuisine absorbs and transforms foreign ingredients
2. **Home Cooking Identity** - The most frequently cooked home meal in China
3. **Diaspora Connection** - Often the first dish Chinese abroad learn to cook
4. **Nutritional Wisdom** - Perfect complementation (eggs lack only vitamin C; tomatoes provide it)
5. **Democratic Food** - From late-night Chengdu stalls to home kitchens worldwide
